# Hello, World! Welcome To My Portfolio + Practice Repository

Here, you will find several folders with various works demonstrating skills I've learned through a combination of self-studying and my post graduate certificate in IT.

Some of these include:

## Loading Concert Cards using JavaScript and CSS Grid

Using a forEach loop, the code dynamically creates and populates data from an external JS file array.


## Using node.js to Retrieve Form Data

Practicing both the GET and POST method to retrieve form data results from a web application.


## Basic Animations with Vanilla HTML and CSS

Exploring the use of CSS animations to create hover, glowing effects, drop downs on load and hidden visibility.


## Bootstrap 4 Basic Skeleton Site

Exploring the use of BS4 to style a site quicker than with CSS from scratch.


## Changing Text with addEventListener and onclick

Using vanilla JS, changing original text to something new based on the click event.




## And more to come..
